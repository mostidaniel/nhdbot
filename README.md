## Q&A
**Why can't I install this? It shows up some error.**\
Make sure that you're using Node v12.x. I might change this in the future to support latest versions.

**How do I set it up with PM2?**\
You can view [this StackOverflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31579509/can-pm2-run-an-npm-start-script) for more information.

**How do I update this if there is a new release?**\
Just use the `git pull` command in the cloned repository directory.
